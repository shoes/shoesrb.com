Memorial Day Weekend 2012 was a big one for the Shoes community!
Here's a taste of what was discussed, decided, and built over this one 3-day weekend.
(Don't you people take a holiday?!)

* Christened "Shoes4" as a fork of shoes/brown_shoes.  This is the TDD/Test-First re-design of the Shoes Insoles (internals).
** Shoes "backends" will be composition-oriented under Shoes namespace, so Shoes::Swt is the first framework.
* Startup issues fixed for OSX/Linux
* Bundler gemspec configuration
* TravisCI integration configured
* Much MUCH discussion around Namespaces and Mixin-vs-Composition

I am personally really exited about the commitment and effort put forth on this
"holiday" weekend.   I was truly stunned to read my Inbox on Sunday Afternoon and find about
a dozen discussion emails to read-through.  Awesome!

Shoes4 has a great start.  Thanks to the team for your continued interest and commitment
to bring us towards a new pair of Shoes.
