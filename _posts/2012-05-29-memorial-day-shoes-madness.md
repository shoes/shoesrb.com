<p>Memorial Day Weekend 2012 was a big one for the Shoes community!
Here&#39;s a taste of what was discussed, decided, and built over this one 3-day weekend.
(Don&#39;t you people take a holiday?!)</p>

<ul>
<li>Christened &quot;Shoes4&quot; as a fork of shoes/brown_shoes.  This is the TDD/Test-First re-design of the Shoes Insoles (internals).
** Shoes &quot;backends&quot; will be composition-oriented under Shoes namespace, so Shoes::Swt is the first framework.</li>
<li>Startup issues fixed for OSX/Linux</li>
<li>Bundler gemspec configuration</li>
<li>TravisCI integration configured</li>
<li>Much MUCH discussion around Namespaces and Mixin-vs-Composition</li>
</ul>

<p>I am personally really exited about the commitment and effort put forth on this
&quot;holiday&quot; weekend.   I was truly stunned to read my Inbox on Sunday Afternoon and find about
a dozen discussion emails to read-through.  Awesome!</p>

<p>Shoes4 has a great start.  Thanks to the team for your continued interest and commitment
to bring us towards a new pair of Shoes.</p>
