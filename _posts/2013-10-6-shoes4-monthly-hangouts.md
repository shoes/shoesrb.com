  <p></p>
  <p>We had the first of our monthly Google Hangouts to talk about Shoes 4 earlier this month. It was great to meet everyone, and it was super exciting to talk about all the different things regarding Shoes:
    <ul>
      <li> We got to know each other better after our GitHub exchanges and learn about our different backgrounds.</li>

      <li> We discussed the remaining issues under the alpha milestone on GitHub and how to go about tackling them. There are currently <a href="https://github.com/shoes/shoes4/issues?milestone=2&amp;page=1&amp;state=open">8 issues open for the alpha release</a> and <a href="https://github.com/shoes/shoes4/issues?labels=Newcomer+Friendly&amp;milestone=&amp;page=1&amp;state=open">5 newcomer friendly issues</a> open.</li>

      <li> We addressed other issues brought up by members of the Hangout and provided feedback wherever possible.</li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <p>We decided to continue holding our Google Hangouts the first Tuesday of every month at 1600 UTC for an hour at most, so our next one will be November 5th at 1600 UTC. This is definitely up for discussion, but for now we have found that time/day seems to work. Feel free to add Shoes to your circles on <a href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/b/115048537762125064206/115048537762125064206/posts">Google Hangouts</a>, and we will post the link to join the Hangout on there :)
    <ul>
      <li> Newcomers are definitely welcome! We can talk about what you can work on and guide you in the right direction if you need help.</li>

      <li> You can also feel free to just listen in too. You can mute your microphone throughout and chime in if you feel like it.</li>

      <li> To bring something to the agenda, you can post on the G+ page or bring it up in the Hangout if you want to talk about a specific issue.</li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <p>Thanks to Davor, Tobi, Eric, James, and Sebastjan for hanging out with us this past month and the great conversation that ensued! Hope you all can make it again next month!
  </p>

  <p>For those that cannot make it, we will be using <a href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/b/115048537762125064206/115048537762125064206/videos">Hangouts on Air </a>to put the videos on Youtube for anyone who wants to check out our talks.

  <p>Shoes on and see you all next month! :)</p>
