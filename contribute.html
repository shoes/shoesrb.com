          <p> There is a new mailing list since the old one fell into the bit bucket!
          Sadly, you'll have to resubscribe and the archives will not be converted. 
          Discuss Shoes 3.x and Shoes 4, ask for help or pointers or just admire us. </p>

          <h2>Facebook</h2>
          <p>We have a Facebook group.  Let people know what Shoes can do. Meet other Shoes people. Post some screen shots of your application. Perhaps a video? Commercial promotion is fine with us as long as it's Shoes relevant. Have Fun!</p>
