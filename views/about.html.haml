      ## History
      Way way back in the day, there was a guy named
      [_why](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Why_the_lucky_stiff). He created a
      project known as [Hackety Hack](http://hackety-hack.com) to teach
      programming to everyone. In order to reach all corners of the earth,
      \_why decided to make Hackety Hack work on Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux.
      This was a lot of work, and so \_why decided to share his toolkit with
      the world. Thus, Shoes was born.

      Everybody loved Shoes. Many apps were made, and put into
      [The Shoebox](http://the-shoebox.org/). But, one day, \_why left.
      In his memory, Team Shoes assembled, and carried on making Shoes. They
      released Shoes 3 in late summer 2010.

      ## Shoes 4
      Shoes 4 is a total re-write of Shoes. It's being done in JRuby. There are
      a few related projects:

      ShoesSpec: An executable specification for Shoes implementations, so that
      others can co-exist. A few other Shoes projects exist already, and a
      unified interface will be great.

      Shoes-mocks: Sort of the opposite, a dummy
      set of Shoes that you can use to test applications written in Shoes.

      The website: A new website is being made as well. Help here would be just
      as awesome as work on Shoes itself.
