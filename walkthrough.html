title: Shoes! The Tutorial Walkthrough
---

<h1 id='hello'>Hello!</h1>

<p>In case you&#8217;ve just arrived: Shoes is a graphics toolkit for writing colorful apps using <a href='http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/'>the Ruby programming language</a>. Ruby is built into Shoes.</p>

<p><img alt='000.jpg' src='./img/wt/000.jpg' /></p>

<p>Shoes wants to fit in. It will change the way it looks for each person&#8217;s computer. These screenshots were taken on my computer, but when you run them for yourself they will look just like your other programs. Try it!</p>
<hr />
<h2 id='the_tutorial_walkthrough'>The Tutorial Walkthrough</h2>

<p>Okay, so, a simple Shoes program.</p>
<div class='row2'>
  <img src='./img/wt/001.png' />
  <pre class='wt'>
    <code class='ruby'>
      Shoes.app { button "Push me" }
    </code>
  </pre>
</div>
<p>You can just save the program in a file called little.rb and open it with Shoes. The braces <code>{</code> and <code>}</code> are a kind of container. The button is &#8220;in&#8221; the app.</p>
<hr />
<p>We can place a few buttons in a <em>stack</em>.</p>
<div class='row2'>
  <img src='./img/wt/002.png' />
  <pre class='wt'>
    <code class='ruby'>
      Shoes.app {
        stack {
          button "A bed of clams"
          button "A coalition of cheetahs"
          button "A gulp of swallows"
        }
      }
    </code>
  </pre>
</div>
<p>Stacks are essential! The most important two elements in Shoes are <em>stacks</em> and <em>flows</em>.</p>
<hr />
<p>Okay, let&#8217;s give the stack a bit of a <em>margin</em>. Scoot it out from the edge.</p>
<div class='row2'>
  <img src='./img/wt/003.png' />
  <pre class='wt'>
    <code class='ruby'>
      Shoes.app {
        background white
        stack(:margin => 8) {
          button "A bed of clams"
          button "A coalition of cheetahs"
          button "A gulp of swallows"
        }
      }
    </code>
  </pre>
</div>
<p>We also painted the <em>background</em> white. Did you see that?</p>
<!--
TODO:  Make the margin 50.  It has to be noticeable.
TODO:  Change the background to another more noticeable colour.  Re-screenshot.
--><hr />
<p>Time for something new, artwork! Let&#8217;s draw!</p>
<div class='row2'>
  <img src='./img/wt/004.png' />
  <pre class='wt'>
    <code class='ruby'>
      Shoes.app {
        oval(
          :left => 10,
          :top => 10,
          :radius => 40
        )
      }
    </code>
  </pre>
</div>
<p>The Shoes brush always starts out black.</p>

<p>Notice that while buttons just dropped into the window, we drew the circle at a specific place. At 10 pixels from the left edge of the window and 10 pixels below the top edge.</p>
<hr />
<p>Now, a rectangle and an arrow.</p>
<div class='row2'>
  <img src='./img/wt/005.png' />
  <pre class='wt'>
    <code class='ruby'>
      Shoes.app {
        fill red
        rect(
          :left => 10,
          :top => 10,
          :width => 40
        )
        arrow(
          :left => 30,
          :top => 60,
          :width => 40
        )
      }
    </code>
  </pre>
</div>
<p>The <em>fill</em> is red on these shapes. And the <em>stroke</em> is black. (Because we didn&#8217;t change it.) These two pens - stroke and fill - draw every shape.</p>

<p>Did you see how the arrow is a little overtop of the rectangle?</p>
<!--
TODO:  Change the colour of the two shapes.  Then update the screenshot.
--><hr />
<p>Of course, you can always design your app with an <em>image</em>. Even images from the web!</p>
<div class='row2'>
<img src='./img/wt/nks-kidnap.png' />
  <pre class='wt'>
  <code class='ruby'>
  Shoes.app {
    image "http://spiralofhope.com/i/ruby-shoes--nks-kidnap.png"
  }
  </code>
  </pre>
</div><!--
As of 2011-08-27, GitHub does not allow hotlinking.  If a Shoes program tries to use an image that is stored on a GitHub server, nothing will display.  This is why this example image must be hosted elsewhere.  The image will still be placed in the github repository and referred-to locally, so we don't ever lose it.

The remotely-hosted image was also edited to remove the toolbar.  It's been archived locally so it doesn't get lost.
-->
<p>Shoes even caches images in memory and on disk, like browsers do. Images are loaded in background threads as well, to prevent apps from slowing down.</p>
<hr />
<p>Now, a very important element: the <em>para</em>. As in: paragraph. Probably the third most important element (after stacks and flows.)</p>
<div class='row2'>
  <img src='./img/wt/007.png' />
  <pre class='wt'>
    <code class='ruby'>
      Shoes.app {
        para strong("Q."), " Are you beginning to grasp hold of Shoes?"
      }
    </code>
  </pre>
</div><hr />
<p>Beyond para, you&#8217;ve got <em>title</em> and <em>subtitle</em>, which are bigger fonts. You can add a bunch of font styles as well. Look for <em>strong</em> and <em>em</em> in this bit.</p>
<div class='row2'>
<img src='./img/wt/008.png' />
<pre class='wt'>
  <code class='ruby'>
  Shoes.app {
    stack(:margin => 6) {
      title "A Question"
      para strong("Q."), " Are you beginning to grasp hold of Shoes?"
      para em(strong("A."), " Quit pestering me, I'm hacking here.")
    }
  }
  </code>
</pre>
</div><hr />
<p>Keep track of stuff by naming them as variables.</p>
<div class='row2'>
<img src='./img/wt/009.png' />
<pre class='wt'>
  <code class='ruby'>
  Shoes.app {
    @push = button "Push me"
    @note = para "Nothing pushed so far"
  }
  </code>
</pre>
</div><hr />
<p>You can then put the variables into action. When the button is clicked, the <code>@note</code> changes to the message shown in the picture.</p>
<div class='row2'>
<img src='./img/wt/010.png' />
<pre class='wt'>
  <code class='ruby'>
  Shoes.app {
    @push = button "Push me"
    @note = para "Nothing pushed so far"
    @push.click {
      @note.replace "Aha! Click!"
    }
  }
  </code>
</pre>
</div><hr />
<p>See if you can figure out this one. How does the gradient work? How are the letters styled?</p>
<div class='row2'>
<img src='./img/wt/011.png' />
<pre class='wt'>
  <code class='ruby'>
  Shoes.app do
    background "#F3F".."#F90"
    title(
      "Shoooes",
      :top => 60,
      :align => "center",
      :font => "Trebuchet MS",
      :stroke => white
    )
  end
  </code>
</pre>
</div>
<p>In this example, I used <em>do</em> and end <em>rather</em> than the braces <code>{</code> and <code>}</code>. They have the same meaning.</p>
<hr />
<p>Aha, here&#8217;s a flow. It keeps the text box and the button side-by-side.</p>
<div class='row2'>
<img src='./img/wt/012.png' />
<pre class='wt'>
  <code class='ruby'>
  Shoes.app do
    background "#EFC"
    border(
      "#BE8",
      :strokewidth => 6
    )
    stack(:margin => 12) do
      para "Enter your name"
      flow do
        edit_line
        button "OK"
      end
    end
  end
  </code>
</pre>
</div><hr />
<p>In this one, we make a five-point star. And it follows the mouse around as you move.</p>
<div class='row2'>
<img src='./img/wt/013.png' />
<pre class='wt'>
  <code class='ruby'>
  Shoes.app do
    @shape = star(:points => 5)
    motion do |left, top|
      @shape.move left, top
    end
  end
  </code>
</pre>
</div><hr />
<p>On to a taste of animation. The Shoes icon moves randomly a bunch of times each second.</p>
<div class='row2'>
<img src='/img/wt/014.png' />
<pre class='wt'>
  <code class='ruby'>
  Shoes.app do
    @shoes = image(
      "http://spiralofhope.com/i/ruby-shoes--shoes.png",
      :top => 100,
      :left => 100
    )
    animate do |i|
      @shoes.top += (-20..20).rand
      @shoes.left += (-20..20).rand
    end
  end
  </code>
</pre>
</div><hr /><!--
TODO:  Update this screenshot to remove the blank line at the top.
-->
<p>Remember a few examples ago when we handled a button click? How about doing the same with a link?</p>
<div class='row2'>
<img src='/img/wt/015.png' />
<pre class='wt'>
  <code class='ruby'>
    Shoes.app do
      @poem = stack do
        para "My eyes have blinked again
    And I have just realized
    This upright world
    I have been in.
    My eyelids wipe
    My eyes hundreds of times
    Reseting and renovating
    The scenery."
      end
      para(
        link("Clear").click do
          @poem.clear
        end
      )
    end
  </code>
</pre>
</div>
<p>So, when the link gets clicked, the stack gets cleared. The poem will disappear.</p>
<hr />
<p>Okay, last one for now. Let&#8217;s generate a hundred random circles. This example also uses the <em>rgb</em> method to make colors from red, green and blue fractions.</p>
<div class='row2'>
<img src='/img/wt/016.png' />
  <pre class='wt'>
    <code class='ruby'>
    Shoes.app(:width => 300, :height => 400) do
      fill rgb(0, 0.6, 0.9, 0.1)
      stroke rgb(0, 0.6, 0.9)
      strokewidth 0.25
      100.times do
        oval(
          :left => (-5..self.width).rand,
          :top => (-5..self.height).rand,
          :radius => (25..50).rand
        )
      end
    end
    </code>
  </pre>
</div>
<p>Don&#8217;t worry if you haven&#8217;t picked up a whole lot reading through these. To get the hang of it, you&#8217;ll need to alter these yourself. Try fiddling with the numbers and colors. Experiment, you know?</p>
